#### User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```



#### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer‚Äôs name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern‚Äôs name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```



#### Installation: Inquirer and Jest Packages Required

üì¶Please install the node package INQUIRER in your terminal  to use this application. This package is used so that the roster can be filled out in the terminal and generated into a webpage application.

Enter the following code in the terminal to install the packages:

```
npm install inquirer
npm install jest
```

In order to run tests on the application, install the JEST package, and run `npm run test`  from the terminal.



#### Usage

Clone the above 10-Team-Generator repo and install the node packages listed above (inquirer and jest). Use the command line to navigate to the root of the application (index.js) and open in the integrated terminal. Run node index.js in the terminal. Follow the prompts in order to add team members and their information to your roster. Only one manager can be added per team. When finished, your team roster will be generated onto a new webpage called team.html located in the src folder that can be opened in the browser.
